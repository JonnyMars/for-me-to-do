## ForMeToDo - React ToDo App

Yes, I have done the ultimate clich√©, I have created a ToDo app.  After completing a React course on Udemy a few months back now (as of July 2021), I decided to create a React app from scratch.  I've never dabbled in the world of ToDo apps before, so I thought why not.  When creating this, I was attempting to use my learning from the course and really utilise as much as I could from memory before resorting to the mighty Google.

As happens with pretty much 90% of every dev's projects, other things caught my eye and I slowly lost interest in this for other things.  If I were to carry on I'd look into making a pretty landing page and adding in "Forgot Your Password" functionality for a start.  I was satisfied to just get this over the line as a personal project; I'm not expecting anyone to actually use this as it's only a personal project.

### Auth and Storage
To handle Auth and storage, I used Firebase.

### Hosting
I hosted this site using Netlify, you can find a hosted version of the site here - [https://formetodo.netlify.app/signup](https://formetodo.netlify.app/signup).  You can even sign up and create some tasks, but remember - don't forget your password as there isn't any reset password functionality built in!
